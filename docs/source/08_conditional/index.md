# Conditional in Programming

In programming, a condition is a statement or expression that evaluates to either true or false. Conditions are fundamental to controlling the flow of a program, allowing different actions to be taken based on the outcome of the condition. They are commonly used in decision-making structures like if statements, loops, and other control flow constructs.
