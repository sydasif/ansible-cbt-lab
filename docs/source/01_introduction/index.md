# Introduction to Network Automation

In the past, network engineers used command-line interfaces (CLI) to configure network devices. However, human errors can occur, and mistakes made by network engineers can lead to network breakdowns. For instance, configuring a wrong IP address in a large network with 60+ devices can take a long time to correct. To address these issues, automation has become a crucial tool for network engineers. Powerful tools like Python and Ansible are widely used in network automation. However, it's important to understand these tools well because mistakes can still happen, and the more powerful the tool, the greater the potential damage.
