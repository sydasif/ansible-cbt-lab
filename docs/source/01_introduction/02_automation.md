## [Ansible for Network Automation](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/network/index.html)

Automation in network management has become crucial in modern IT environments, and understanding the models and tools available is essential for network engineers. This introduction will guide you through the fundamentals of Ansible automation, emphasizing its practical advantages and ease of adoption, especially for those without extensive programming skills.

Ansible initially focused on managing servers but has since extended its capabilities to include network devices. The core concepts, including modules and playbooks, remain consistent between server and network management, though there are some differences tailored to network automation. This expansion allows for a unified approach to managing both servers and network equipment, streamlining IT operations and improving efficiency.

### What is a Push Model?

In automation, a push model refers to a system where the central server sends commands or configurations directly to managed nodes. Ansible operates on a push model, meaning it pushes configurations from a central control machine to the nodes it manages.

### What is a Pull Model?

Conversely, a pull model involves managed nodes periodically checking in with a central server to fetch and apply new configurations. This approach is often seen in tools like Puppet, Chef, and SaltStack.

### Ansible's Approach to Automation

Ansible is renowned for its simplicity and accessibility, particularly for network engineers who may not have a background in programming. Ansible operates in a procedural manner, where tasks are executed sequentially as defined in playbooks. This straightforward approach is enhanced by Ansibleâ€™s support for declarative models through technologies like NETCONF and RESTCONF, allowing for more flexible and scalable network management.

### Ease of Adoption for Network Engineers

For network engineers looking to automate tasks without diving into complex programming, Ansible is an excellent choice. The primary requirement is an understanding of YAML, the human-readable data serialization standard used to write Ansible playbooks. With YAML, network engineers can define tasks, configurations, and workflows in a clear and concise manner.

### Built-In Concurrency

One of Ansible's significant advantages over traditional Python scripting is its built-in concurrency. Ansible allows for parallel execution of tasks across multiple nodes, significantly speeding up deployment times and ensuring consistent configurations.

## Getting Started with Network Automation

Ansible modules support a wide range of vendors, device types, and actions, so you can manage your entire network with a single automation tool. This versatility makes Ansible a powerful solution for network automation, allowing you to automate routine tasks and ensure consistency across your network infrastructure. Ansible handles communication between the control node and managed nodes through multiple protocols:

* **network_cli by SSH:** A widely-used protocol for managing network devices, ensuring secure and reliable communication.
* **netconf by SSH:** A protocol designed specifically for network management, offering enhanced capabilities for configuration and monitoring.
* **httpapi by HTTP/HTTPS:** A flexible and efficient protocol for interacting with network devices that support RESTful APIs.

Network platforms supported by Ansible are:

* **Arista: eos:** Providing robust automation capabilities for Arista's Extensible Operating System.
* **Cisco: ios, iosxr, nxos:** Enabling comprehensive management of Cisco's diverse range of network operating systems, from traditional IOS to the advanced features of IOS-XR and NX-OS.
* **Juniper: junos:** Facilitating powerful automation for Juniper's Junos OS, known for its flexibility and performance.
* **VyOS: vyos:** Supporting automation for VyOS, an open-source network operating system, ideal for various networking tasks.

With Ansible's extensive support for different network platforms and protocols, you can streamline your network automation processes and achieve greater operational efficiency.

### [Network Modules](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/network/getting_started/network_differences.html#how-network-automation-is-different)

Unlike most Ansible modules, network modules do not run on the managed nodes due to the inability of most network devices to run Python. Instead, these modules are executed on the Ansible control node. This different methodology ensures that Ansible can still manage network devices effectively. Additionally, network modules use the control node as a destination for backup files, typically storing them in the backup directory under the playbook root directory. This approach allows Ansible to provide consistent network management and backup capabilities without the need for Python on the network devices themselves.

With Ansible, network engineers can streamline their workflows, reduce manual interventions, and achieve greater consistency and reliability in their network operations. This introduction sets the stage for exploring Ansible's capabilities and understanding how it can transform network management practices.
