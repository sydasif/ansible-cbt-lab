# Variables in Programming

Variables are key in both programming and configuration management. They help manage dynamic values, making scripts and playbooks flexible and reusable. In this chapter, we'll start with a brief overview of variables in programming and then explore their use in Ansible, focusing specifically on group variables `group_vars` and host variables `host_vars`.
