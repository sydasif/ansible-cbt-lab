# Jinja2 Templates and Ansible

Jinja2 is a popular templated engine for Python. It allows you to create dynamic templates that can be rendered with specific data. This means you can generate HTML, XML, or other markup formats with variable data inserted into predefined templates.

In network automation, Jinja2 helps automate the generation of configuration files for various network devices. Instead of manually creating configurations for each device, you can use Jinja2 templates to create them dynamically based on different parameters.
