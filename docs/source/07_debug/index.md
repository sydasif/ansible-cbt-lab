# Verifying Configuration Changes in Ansible

When we push a configuration to a device, Ansible provides a summary indicating whether something has changed or failed. However, it does not show us the exact commands executed. To verify the configuration, we typically log in to the device and run some show commands manually. In this chapter, we will discuss how to capture the commands executed to see what changes we have made.
